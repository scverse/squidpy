# Squidpy Benchmarks

This directory contains code for benchmarking Squidpy using [asv][].

The functionality is checked using the [`benchmark.yml`][] workflow.
Benchmarks are run using the [benchmark bot][].

[`benchmark.yml`]: ../.github/workflows/benchmark.yml

## Data processing in benchmarks

Each dataset is processed so it has

- `.X` (containing data in C/row-major format) and `.layers['off-axis']` (containing data in FORTRAN/column-major format) with log-transformed data

The benchmarks are set up so the `layer` parameter indicates the layer that will be moved into `.X` before the benchmark.
That way, we donâ€™t need to add `layer=layer` everywhere.
