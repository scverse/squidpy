**Squidpy** is a tool for the analysis and visualization of spatial molecular data.
It builds on top of `scanpy`_ and `anndata`_, from which it inherits modularity and scalability.
It provides analysis tools that leverages the spatial coordinates of the data, as well as
tissue images if available.

Visit our `documentation`_ for installation, tutorials, examples and more.

Please see our `preprint`_ on **bioRxiv** to learn more.

Squidpy's key applications
--------------------------
- Build and analyze the neighborhood graph from spatial coordinates.
- Compute spatial statistics for cell-types and genes.
- Efficiently store, analyze and visualize large tissue images, leveraging `skimage`_.
- Explore `anndata`_ and the large tissue image in `napari`_.

Installation
------------
Install Squidpy via PyPI by running::

    pip install squidpy
